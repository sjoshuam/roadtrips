        Over the years, I have built many models to provide actionable insights into the human
        and constructued systems that keep the United States running.  One of my life goals is to
        actually see the nation I routinely examine in my work. Towards that end, I aspire to visit
        and photograph at least:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b class="item">Capitals:</b> Every state's capital city.
        <li> <b class="item">States:</b> At least one of each state's most populous non-capital
            metropolitan areas.
        <li> <b class="item">Population Centers:</b> Nearly all metropolitan areas with populations
            greater than one million.
        <li> <b class="item">Significant Sites:</b> UNESCO-listed noteworthy historical, cultural,
            or ecological sites.
    </ul>


    <p>
        This information dashboard tracks my progress towards achiving these goals and provides 
        planning information for my future trips.  There are three data displays.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> <b class="item">Goal Progress (top-right panel):</b> These figures depict my progress
            towards achiving my goals. Use the slider bar to see progress counted separately for
            each region or in total.
        <li> <b class="item">Travels and Weather (middle panels):</b> These maps depict my
            past travels, remaining destinations, and the typical weather in each place during each
            month.
        <li> <b class="item">Destination Distances (bottom panels):</b> This dendrogram depicts
            the distances between cities, grouping nearby cities together for easy reference while
            planning future trips.
        </ul>
    <p>
        I consider a destination visited and photographed only if I have (a) walked at
        least one mile in the area and (b) taken at least three architectural photographs.
        I have visited/photographed <insert>BOTTOMLINE</insert> of the 120 places on my goal list so far.

        The map panel on the left depicts my travels and goal destinations, as well as the
        typical weather conditions in those places.  Drag the slider bar to see each of the
        maps.  Hover over destinations (the cities) and routes (lines between cities) to see
        additional information specific to each map.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b class="item">Travels (Cities): </b>
            Depicts each of the 120 goal destinations as circles.  Circle shading indicates which
            places I visited and photographed (bright, filled-in), visited long ago
            without photographing (dim, filled-in), or have not visited at all (very dim, hollow).
            Hover over each circle to see why it made the list, how many miles I have walked there,
            and when I last photographed it. Four destinations are outside the contiguous United
            States.  They are shown separately in the panel above.
        <li><b class="item">Travels (Routes): </b>
            Depicts the most recent trip that passed through each visited/photographed place. Hover
            over the trip lines to see the year, trip name, and destination for that particular
            trip segment.  As the segments show, I have visited many other places along the way to goal
            destinations.
        <li><b class="item">Temperate Weather: </b>
            The remaining twelve maps score each destination's weather in terms of average temperate
            hours per day in each month. For this purpose, I define "temperate" as having an ambient
            temperature between 50°F and 75°F. Brighter, filled-in circles
            indicate many hours of temperate weather on a typical day. Hover over each circle to see the
            typical number of temperate hour per day as well as the Koppen climate classification
            for that region. Weather maps use a different color 
            (<span style="color:#cc6699;">rose red</span>) to prevent confusion.
    </ul>

    <p>
        The dendrogram panel on the right depicts the distances between destinations that I have
        not yet visited and photographed. Trace the brackets between any pair of places.  The 
        horizontal height of the lines between them roughly corresponds to the distance
        between them.  Groups of destinations that all have short-horizontal connections between
        them are good candidates for future travel routes.
        <br><br>
        The dots in the middle of each bracket provide information on the group of destinations
        that the bracket represents.  Hover over each dot to see the place that is most central
        to all places in that group, plus the number of other places in the group. Where space
        permits, this information is also visible as text beside the dot.
        <br><br>
        The next version of this figure will be an interactive planning tool. (GitHub Issue #22)
