        Years ago, I built my first simulation model of population dynamics in the United States.
        I got to know US places and population centers very well, realizing how few I
        had experienced in person. I set out on my first roadtrip with little more than a rough
        list of a few places and boundless curiosity. Since then, I have traveled thousands of
        miles, and evolved my ambitions. These days, my domestic travel goals include visiting:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> The nation's most populous cities
        <li> Every state's capital city
        <li> Every state's most populous city
        <li> Select UNESCO World Heritage Sites
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information dashboard tracks my past progress towards achieving my goals and provides 
        planning information for my future trips.
